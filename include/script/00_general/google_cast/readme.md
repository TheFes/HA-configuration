# Background
I've created several scripts related to Google Home devices, mainly related to resuming the audio

# The scripts
## Google Home Resume
* Resume your Google Cast devices after they have been interupted by an action. For example after sending a TTS, or playing a ding dong sound when there is someone at the door.
The script can be triggered manually, but also by use of an automation. Both are combined in a package.

* [Link to the package](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/integrations/packages/google_cast/google_home_resume.yaml)

## Google Home Voice
* Issue a voice command to your Google Cast device, and the script can determine to which device the actions should be sent.

* [Link to the script ](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/script/00_general/google_cast/google_home_voice.yaml)

## Google Home Event
* Can stop your devices based on an event (e.g. leaving your home) and resume them on another (e.g. arriving home again). The script uses a trigger based template binary sensor. Both are combined in a package
* [Link to documentation](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/integrations/packages/google_cast/docs/google_home_event.md)
* [Link to the package](https://github.com/TheFes/HA-configuration/blob/main/include/integrations/packages/google_cast/google_home_event.yaml)

## Google Home TTS
* Send a TTS to a Google Home device with a screen together with a picture and some text.

# Buy me a coffee
If you like these scripts, please feel free to buy me a coffee (I might spend it on another beverage though).
In case you decide to do so, thanks a lot!
