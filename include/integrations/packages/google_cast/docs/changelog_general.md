# Changelog

* General changes for the [Google Home Resume package](../google_home_resume.yaml)
* More information [here](../readme.md)

### 2022.12.0

#### ðŸŒŸ Improvements

* All scripts related to the Google Home devices are now combined in one package. This brings toghether the Google Home Resume, Google Home Voice and Google Home Event script. For me it makes it easier to update them, I can make more efficient usage of YAML anchors,so I don't need to update templates and settings in 3 places.
* A lot of bigger and smaller template fixes
* More usage of YAML anchors, which also reduces the total number of lines for the combined scripts
