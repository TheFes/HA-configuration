My config ðŸ˜Š

I'm Dutch so entity names are mostly in Dutch, entity_id's as well mostly, but I might change that in the future.
Everything displayed on the dashboard is Dutch.

I'm working on translating all the other stuff, scripts and automations and template sensors are mostly done.
If you want to know something more, just let me know ðŸ˜Ž

For my Dashboard I use Mushroom cards.
The main view consists of room-cards (built using stack-in-cards) with the important stuff of that room. You can toggle light (groups), sitch (groups) and/or covers from the main view. Clicking on a room name takes you to the room for more details.

# Buy me a coffee
If you think I deserve a coffe, please feel free to buy me one (I might spend it on another beverage though).
In case you decide to do so, thanks a lot!
