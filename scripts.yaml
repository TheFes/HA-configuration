        cancel its fade since that 8% difference is >= 5%. Note—if you use this, Ashley
        doesn’t recommend setting this to anything less than about 3; that’s just
        because it can be normal for there to be an occasional difference of 1 or
        2 since not all lamps instantly reflect newly assigned brightness values due
        to processing lag and other factors. In Ashley’s home, she personally uses
        a value of about 5 for this.
