# Adjust the entities for your calendar, TODO, and weather.
# Adjust the send notification intent names, descriptions, and the notify.mobile_app_x service calls.
# Restart HA.

# Then you can say:
# "you can chain tool calls, send tomorrow's calendar events after summarizing them to Marisol" (this will call CalendarGetEvents followed by SendNotificationMarisol)
# "what's in my todo list" "send them to Nikos"
# "who created Home Assistant" "send your response to Nikos"
# "send a message to Nikos: hi there"
# "what's in my calendar for today"
# "what's in my calendar for tomorrow"
# "what's in my todo list" BTW, with the built in intents you can add items to a list, e.g. "add buy milk to my personal tasks"
#
#
# The sentences here are only used by the built in Home Assistant agent. They are not used or seen by LLMs.
